# expose

Implements the "expose" effect, showing every client window on the focused screen.

For a similar feature using a menu, try the [fetch_client_menu](./fetch_client_menu) plugin (less intrusive).

Sample `hyprland.conf`:

```bash
# Setup the key binding
bind = $mainMod, B, exec, pypr expose

# Add some style to the "exposed" workspace
workspace = special:exposed,gapsout:60,gapsin:30,bordersize:5,border:true,shadow:false
```

`MOD+B` will bring every client to the focused workspace, pressed again it will go to this workspace.

Check [workspace rules](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/#rules) for styling options.

> [!note]
> If you are looking for `toggle_minimized`, check the [toggle_special](./toggle_special) plugin
